Phase III
___________________________________________________________________________
Monday Nov 23, first Planning meeting:
    Notes:
        One person (Chris) missing from meeting due to part time job,
        notified later nonetheless.

    Accomplished in meeting:
        Decided Activities for User Login and Flight / Itinerary Searching
        will be completed for Phase IIIa (to demonstrate in interview).

        Analysed major distinctions in Phase III requirements list compared
        to phase II requirements list, listed each big change in a to-do
         list.

        Read over phase III handout and delegated responsibilites to members
        before next meeting.

    Problems found:
        Our phase II implementation is incomplete, it is likely that
        Sooham will have to complete the incomplete and faulty aspects
        of Phase II before others can work.

    Tasks for this week:
        Sooham:
            Finish all faulty methods, classes from Phase II.

            Write updated CRC cards to reflect frontend Activities and
            Backend changes in requirements file

            Get Android Studio Virtual Android Device working

            Get Login Activity running

            Work on backend to allow User login
        Badis:
            Leave Login backend to Angad

            Implement Admin class by subclassing User

            Implement Client class by subclassing User

        Chris:
            Update Flight and Itinerary classes to account
            for seat numbering

            for addition of seat numbering
