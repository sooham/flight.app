___________________________________________________________________________

############# IMPORTANT NOTE ###########################
####### Sooham Rafiz (c4rafizs) has additional (70+ commit) made for PIII ##############
######## Please go to the root of this svn repository and see the logs for accurate view #######

in the pII folder (due to android studio being fragile) and to not
conflict with teammate working on frontend

Monday Nov 23, first Planning meeting:
    Notes:
        One person (Chris) missing from meeting due to part time job,
        notified later nonetheless.

    Accomplished in meeting:
        Decided Activities for User Login and Flight / Itinerary Searching
        will be completed for Phase IIIa (to demonstrate in interview).

        Analysed major distinctions in Phase III requirements list compared
        to phase II requirements list, listed each big change in a to-do
         list.

        Read over phase III handout and delegated responsibilites to members
        before next meeting.

    Problems found:
        Our phase II implementation is incomplete, it is likely that
        Sooham will have to complete the incomplete and faulty aspects
        of Phase II before others can work.

    Tasks for this week:
        Sooham:
            Finish all faulty methods, classes from Phase II.

            Write updated CRC cards to reflect frontend Activities and
            Backend changes as stated in the requirements list

            Figure out how to join Android Studio and SVN seamlessly

        Angad:
            Get Android Studio Virtual Android Device working

            Get Login Activity running

            Work on backend to allow User login
        Badis:
            Leave Login backend to Angad

            Implement Admin class by subclassing User

            Implement Client class by subclassing User

        Chris:
            Update Flight and Itinerary classes to account
            for seat numbering

            Update FileDatabase CSV reading methods to account
            for addition of seat numbering


Friday Nov 27, second Planning meeting:
    Notes:
        All people present. Chris had knee surgery, he might need some time
        to recover.

    Problems encountered:
        Even though backend is mostly finished, Sooham found that we need
        to change the data structure representation for FlightManager due
        to HashMap identifying String[] keys based on memory referencing,
        not value.

    Tasks completed:
        Sooham:
            All tasks completed
            Helped Badis with Backend Login

        Angad:
            All tasks completed

        Badis:
            All tasks completed.

        Chris:
            All tasks completed.

    Accomplished in meeting:
        Talked about progress and problems, for Sooham's issue with the data
        structure, the team has decided to change the FlightManager to take
        in an ArrayList of String rather than String[].

        We have also looked at where we lost marks in the previous assignment,
        based on the feedback of pII, we have decided to change Itinerary to
        to become and Iterator of Flight, rather than a subclass of Flight.

    Tasks for this week:
        Sooham:
            Write updated CRC cards to reflect backend changes.
            Keep updating backend

        Angad:
            Get Login Activity to log in user, if that is completed, work
            on making Activity for Users (Admin or Client) to edit their
            own personal information (please see getters and setters for User class)

        Badis:
            Help create a logo for the app using graphic design skills

        Chris:
            Talk to Angad and get the app running on your Android studio.
            Try to work on Driver.java after reading through updated backend code from
             Sooham.

Wednesday December 2, first Status meeting:
    Notes:
        Angad not present due to midterm.

    Problems encountered:
        FlightManager had issue that appears 1% of the time input. Needs
